# On-Time-Delivery-Prediction
Predicting On-Time Delivery Using Python Classification Algorithms

This research project focuses on the development of an accurate on-time delivery prediction model using Python. The study incorporates several techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), comprehensive data preprocessing (including cleaning, data standardizing, data transformation, feature engineering, and data splitting), and the application of different machine learning algorithms to assess the model's predictive performance.

The prediction model considers a set of carefully selected variables, namely 'order_date', 'order_status', 'is_2h_delivery', 'is_cancelled', 'seller_region', 'seller_province', 'product_name', 'category', 'nmv', 'order_size', 'payment_method', 'on_time_delivery'. These variables are pivotal in evaluating the risk and likelihood of successful on-time delivery.

The experimental results demonstrate a promising prediction accuracy of approximately 89% in on-time delivery classification.

However, it is important to note that this study is based on a man-made dataset. For reliability, it is highly recommended that the next research should use the real dataset to ensure that the dynamism of variables are accurately reflected the nature of this industry.
